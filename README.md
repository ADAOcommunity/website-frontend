# ADAO Site

## About

The frontend for ADAO's website. To view the backend [referenced solely within `static/main.js`], please view `ADAOcommunity/website-backend` on GitHub.

## Installation

- Ensure NodeJS v16 or above is installed and the Yarn package manager is installed.
- Install all packages with `yarn`.
- Change the first line of `static/main.js`. It's hard to use configuration files with front-facing JavaScript.

### Production
